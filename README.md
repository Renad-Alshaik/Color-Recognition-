# Color Recognition using OpenCV
# Description:
The project involves identifying specific colors in an image and highlighting those areas. For example, you can detect colors such as red, green, or blue in the image and determine the region for the color.. 
'I selected the color red to identify it in the image, and when it is detected, it determines the region'.
# Features
- Detects red color in static images.
- Highlights detected regions for easy visualization.
- Adjustable HSV ranges to support different shades of red.
#  Import Required Libraries
cv2: The OpenCV library is used for image processing.
numpy: Used to create and manage arrays for color ranges.
matplotlib.pyplot: For displaying images in the notebook.
